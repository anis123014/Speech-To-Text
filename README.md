# Speech-To-Text
 In this project, we are going to develop an on-line speech-to-text engine. The system acquires speech at run time through a microphone and processes the sampled speech to recognize the uttered text. The recognized text can be stored in a file. We are developing this on android platform using eclipse workbench  on ADT bundle. Our speech-to-text system directly acquires and converts speech to text . Voice SMS is an application developed in this work that allows a user to record and convert spoken messages into SMS text message. User can send messages to the entered phone number. Speech recognition is done via the Internet, connecting to Google's server. The application is adapted to input messages in English. Speech recognition for Voice uses a technique based on hidden Markov models (HMM - Hidden Markov Model). It is currently the most successful and most flexible approach to speech recognition.
